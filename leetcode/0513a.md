### 1. Base 7 (504)


Given an integer, return its base 7 string representation.

Example 1:
```
Input: 100
Output: "202"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: -7
Output: "-10"
```

Note: The input will be in range of [-1e7, 1e7].

##### working solution:

```
def convert_to_base7(num)
    num.to_s(7)
end
```




### 2. Longest Palindrome (409)
[Hash Table]()

Given a string which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

This is case sensitive, for example "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.

Note:
Assume the length of given string will not exceed 1,010.

Example:
```
Input:
"abccccdd"

Output:
7

Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

#### working solution(100%)

```
def longest_palindrome(s)
    ori = s.length
    result = 0
    while s.length > 0
        result += (s.length - s.delete!(s[0]).length) / 2 * 2
    end
    result < ori ? result + 1 : result
end
```



### 3. Diameter of Binary Tree (543)
[Tree]()

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \     
4   5
```
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.


#### working solution

```
def diameter_of_binary_tree(root)
    return 0 if root.nil?
    return [diameter_of_root(root),diameter_of_binary_tree(root.left),diameter_of_binary_tree(root.right)].max
end

def diameter_of_root(root)
    return 0 if root.nil?
    max_dep(root.left) + max_dep(root.right)
end

def max_dep(root)
    return 0 if root.nil?
    return 1 + [max_dep(root.left),max_dep(root.right)].max
end
```



### 4. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree (108)
[Tree](),
[Depth-first Search]()

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

#### working solution(100%)

```
def sorted_array_to_bst(nums)
    return nil if nums.empty?
    mid = nums.length / 2
    root = TreeNode.new(nums[mid])
    root.left = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[0...mid])
    root.right = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[mid+1..-1])
    return root
end
```


### 5. Add Strings  (415)
[Math]()

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.

Note:

1. The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
2. Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
3. Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
4. You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

#### working solution
```
def add_strings(num1, num2)
    num1 = num1.chars.map{|el|el.ord-48}
    num2 = num2.chars.map{|el|el.ord-48}
    result = 0
    i = 0
    while i < num1.length
        result += num1[i]*(10**(num1.length - 1 -i))
        i += 1
    end
    j = 0
    while j < num2.length
        result += num2[j]*(10**(num2.length - 1 - j))
        j += 1
    end
    result.to_s
end
```


### 6. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal (405)
[Tree]()

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

1. All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
2. The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
3. The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
4. You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

Example 1:
```
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
```

#### working solution

```

```



### 7. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (121)
[Array](),
[Dynamic Programming]()

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Example 1:
```
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```


#### working solution

```
def max_profit(prices)
    prev_min = prices[0]
    max = 0
    i = 0
    while i < prices.length
        max = [max, prices[i]-prev_min].max
        prev_min = [prev_min, prices[i]].min
        i += 1
    end
    max
end
```


### 8. Happy Number (202)
[Hash Table](),
[Math]()

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

1**2 + 9**2 = 82
8**2 + 2**2 = 68
6**2 + 8**2 = 100
1**2 + 0**2 + 0**2 = 1


#### working solution
```
def is_happy(n)
    results = []
    n = calc(n)
    until results.include?(n) || n == 1
        results << n
        n = calc(n)
    end
    n == 1 ? true : false

end

def calc(num)
   num.to_s.chars.map(&:to_i).inject(0){|sum,el|sum + el**2}
end
```


### 9.Power of Three (326)
[Math]()

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Follow up:
Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?

#### working solution

```
def is_power_of_three(n)
    return false if n <= 0
    3**19 % n == 0
end
```

#### loop solution
```
def is_power_of_three(n)
    if n > 1
        while n % 3 == 0
            n /= 3
        end
    end
    return n == 1
end
```

### 10. Power of Two (231)
[Math](),
[Bit Manipulation]()

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two

#### working solution

```
def is_power_of_two(n)
    n > 0 && n.to_s(2).count('1') == 1
end
```

#### recursion solution

```
def is_power_of_two(n)
    return true if n == 1
    return false if n == 0
    return n%2 == 0 && is_power_of_two(n/2)

end
```
