### 1. Repeated Substring Pattern (459)


Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abab"

Output: True

Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "aba"

Output: False
```

Example 3:
```
Input: "abcabcabcabc"

Output: True

Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
```

#### working solution:

```
def repeated_substring_pattern(s)
    i = 0
    while i < s.length/2
        return true if s.length % (i+1) == 0 && s == s[0..i]*(s.length / (i+1))
        i += 1
    end
    return false
end
```

#### better solution:

```
def repeated_substring_pattern(s)
    ss = s + s
    return ss[1..ss.length-2].include?(s)
end
```




### 2. House Robber (198)
[Dynamic Programming]()

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

#### working solution
```
def rob(nums)
    return rob_helper(nums)
end

def rob_helper(nums,arr = {})
    return 0 if nums.empty?
    return nums[0] if nums.length == 1
    return [nums[0],nums[1]].max if nums.length == 2
    return arr[nums] if arr[nums]
    return arr[nums] = [(nums[-1] + rob_helper(nums[0..-3], arr)),(nums[-2] + rob_helper(nums[0..-4], arr))].max
end
```

#### better solution
```
def rob(nums)
    s1 = s2 = 0
    (nums.length).times do |i|
       if i.even?
            s1 = [s1+nums[i], s2].max
       else
            s2 = [s2+nums[i], s1].max
       end
    end

    [s1, s2].max
end
```



### 3. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree (501)
[Tree]()

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],

```
1
 \
  2
 /
2
```

return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).


#### working solution

```
def find_mode(root)
    hash = find_dup(root,{})
    max = hash.values.sort[-1]
    hash.select{|key,value| value == max}.keys
end

def find_dup(root, arr = {})
    return {} if root.nil?
    if arr[root.val]
        arr[root.val] += 1
    else
        arr[root.val] = 1
    end
    find_dup(root.left, arr)
    find_dup(root.right,arr)
    return arr
end
```

#### better solution

```
def find_mode(root)
    @currentValue = nil
    @currentValueCount = 0
    @max = 0
    @result = []

    inorder(root)
    return @result
end

def handleValue value
    if @currentValue != value
        @currentValue = value
        @currentValueCount = 1
    else
        @currentValueCount += 1
    end

    if @currentValueCount > @max
        @max = @currentValueCount
        @result = [value]
    elsif @currentValueCount == @max
        @result << value
    end
end
```



### 4. Remove Element (27)
[Array](),
[Two Pointers]()

Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

#### working solution(100%)

```
def remove_element(nums, val)
    i = 0
    j = nums.length - 1
    return 0 if nums.empty?
    while i < j
        until nums[i] == val || i>=j
            i += 1
        end
        while nums[j] == val && i<j
            j -= 1
        end
        nums[i],nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]

    end
    nums[i] == val ? i : i+1
end
```
