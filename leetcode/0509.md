### 1. Hamming Distance (461)
[Bit Manipulation]()

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 2**31.

Example:

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

##### working solution:

```
def hamming_distance(x, y)
    (x^y).to_s(2).gsub('0','').length
end
```

#### better solution
xor 之后求1出现的次数，
用bitwise and 与 1 比较，
然后进行bitwise right shift
```
def hamming_distance(x, y)
	z = x^y
	result = 0

	while z > 0
		result += z&1
		z >>= 1
	end

	result
end
```



### 2. Array Partition I (561)
[Array]()

Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.
```

Note:
1. n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

#### working solution

```
def array_pair_sum(nums)
    sorted_nums = nums.sort
    i = 0
    sum = 0
    while i < sorted_nums.length
        sum += sorted_nums[i]
        i += 2
    end
    sum
end
```



### 3. Distribute Candies(575)
[Hash Table]()

Given an integer array with even length, where different numbers in this array represent different kinds of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies equally in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of kinds of candies the sister could gain.

Example 1:
```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too.
The sister has three different kinds of candies.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: candies = [1,1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1].
The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies.
```

Note:

1. The length of the given array is in range [2, 10,000], and will be even.
2. The number in given array is in range [-100,000, 100,000].

#### working solution

```
def distribute_candies(candies)
    [candies.uniq.size, candies.size / 2].min
end
```

### 4. Reshape the Matrix (566)
[Array]()

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:
```
Input:
nums =
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output:
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
nums =
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output:
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
```

#### working solution

```
def matrix_reshape(nums, r, c)
    flatten = nums.flatten
    return nums if r*c != flatten.length
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < r*c
        result << flatten[i..i+c-1]
        i += c
    end
    result
end
```
#### best solution (recursion)

```
def matrix_reshape(nums, r, c)
  r * c == nums.flatten.size ? nums.flatten.each_slice(c).to_a : nums
end
```

### 5. Reverse Words in a String III (557)
[String]()

Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example:
```
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

#### working solution

```
def reverse_words(s)
    return s.split(' ').map(&:reverse).join(' ')
end
```

### 6. Number Complement (476)
[Bit Manipulation]()

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

Example 1:
```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

    str2 = 'asdfghjkl'
    str3 = 'zxcvbnm'
    result = []
    words.each do |word|
        word2 = word.downcase
        p word2
        if str1.include?(word2[0])
            test = str1
        elsif str2.include?(word2[0])
            test = str2
        else
            test = str3
        end
        p test
        ok = true
        word2.chars.each do |char|
           ok = false if test.include?(char) == false
        end
        result << word if ok
    end
    result
end
```

#### best solution
use wildcard
```
def find_words(words)
  words.select { |w| w =~ /^([qwertyuiop]*|[asdfghjkl]*|[zxcvbnm]*)$/i }
end
```


### 8. Fizz Buzz (412)

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

Example:
```
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]
```


#### working solution

```
def fizz_buzz(n)
    result = []
    i=1
    while i<=n
        if i % 15 == 0
            result << 'FizzBuzz'
        elsif i % 3 == 0
            result << 'Fizz'
        elsif i % 5 == 0
            result << 'Buzz'
        else
            result << i.to_s
        end
        i += 1
    end
    result
end
```

    i = 0
    while i < s.length/2
        s[i],s[s.length-1-i] = s[s.length-1-i],s[i]
        i += 1
    end
    s

### 10.Next Greater Element I (496)
[Stack]()

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1’s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```

#### working solution(100%)
Key observation:
Suppose we have a decreasing sequence followed by a greater number
For example [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6] then the greater number 6 is the next greater element for all previous numbers in the sequence

We use a stack to keep a decreasing sub-sequence, whenever we see a number x greater than stack.peek() we pop all elements less than x and for all the popped ones, their next greater element is x
For example [9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1, 6]
The stack will first contain [9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1] and then we see 6 which is greater than 1 so we pop 1 2 3 whose next greater element should be 6
```
def next_greater_element(find_nums, nums)
    stack = []
    map = {}
    nums.each do |num|
        if stack.empty? || stack[-1] > num
            stack << num
        else
            while stack.length > 0 && stack[-1] < num
                map[stack[-1]] = num
                stack.pop
            end
            stack << num
        end
    end
    if stack.length > 0
        stack.each{|el| map[el] = -1}
    end
    return find_nums.map{|el| map[el]}
end
```
