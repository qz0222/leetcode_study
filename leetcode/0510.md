### 1. Island Perimeter (463)
[Hash Table]()

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water. Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Example:

```
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Answer: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:
 - x - -
| x x | |
 x - x -
x | | x |
 x - x -
| x x | |
 x - - -
x | x | |
 x x - -
```

##### working solution:

```
def island_perimeter(grid)
    return 0 if grid.length == 0
    total = 0
    num_1 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < grid.length
        j = 0
        prev_j = 0
        while j < grid[0].length
            if grid[i][j] == 1
                total -= 2 if prev_j == 1
                num_1 += 1
            end
            prev_j = grid[i][j]
            j += 1
        end
        i += 1
    end

    m = 0
    while m < grid[0].length
        n = 0
        prev_n = 0
        while n < grid.length
            if grid[n][m] == 1
                total -= 2 if prev_n == 1

            end
            prev_n = grid[n][m]
            n += 1
        end
        m += 1
    end

    return 4*num_1 + total
end
```




### 2. Nim Game (292)
[Brainteaser]()

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.


#### working solution

```
def can_win_nim(n)
    if n >= 4 && n % 4 == 0
        false
    else
        true
    end
end
```



### 3. Max Consecutive Ones (485)
[Array]()

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

Note:

1. The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
2. The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

#### working solution

```
def find_max_consecutive_ones(nums)
    i = 0
    max = 0
    temp = 0
    while i < nums.length
        if nums[i] == 1
            temp += 1
        else
            temp = 0
        end
        max = temp if temp > max
        i += 1
    end
    max
end
```

### 4. Single Number (136)
[Hash Table](),
[Bit Manipulation]()

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

#### working solution
xor
```
def single_number(nums)
    nums.inject(&:^)
end
```


### 5. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I (521)
[String]()

Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this group of two strings. The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.

The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

Example:
```
Input: "aba", "cdc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" (or "cdc"),
because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba",
but not a subsequence of any other strings in the group of two strings.
```
Note:
1. Both strings' lengths will not exceed 100.
2. Only letters from a ~ z will appear in input strings.

#### working solution

```
def find_lu_slength(a, b)
    if a.length > b.length
        return a.length
    elsif a.length < b.length
        return b.length
    end

    i = 0
    max = 0
    while i < a.length
        j = i
        while j < a.length
            max = j - i + 1 if b.include?(a[i..j]) == false && max < j - i + 1
            j += 1
        end
        i += 1
    end
    max == 0? -1 : max
end
```

#### best solution
```
def find_lu_slength(a, b)
    if a == b
        return -1
    end
    return [a.size, b.size].max
end
```

### 6. Detect Capital (520)
[String]()

Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital if it has more than one letter, like "Google".
Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.

Example 1:
```
Input: "USA"
Output: True
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "FlaG"
Output: False
```

Note: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.

#### working solution
```
def detect_capital_use(word)
    return word == word.upcase || word == word.downcase || word == word.capitalize
end
```

### 7. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array (448)
[Array]()

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

Example:
```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

#### working solution

```
def find_disappeared_numbers(nums)
    i = 0
    result = []
    while i < nums.length
        idx = nums[i].abs - 1
        nums[idx] *= -1 if nums[idx] > 0
        i += 1
    end
    nums.each_with_index{|value, idx| result << idx + 1 if value > 0}
    result
end
```



### 8. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (104)
[Tree](),
[Depth-first Search]()

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


#### working solution

```
def max_depth(root)
    return 0 if root.nil?
    return [max_depth(root.left), max_depth(root.right)].max + 1
end
```


### 9. Find the Difference (389)
[Hash Table](),
[Bit Manipulation]()

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

#### working solution
```
def find_the_difference(s, t)
    map = Hash.new(0)
    s.chars.each{|char| map[char] += 1}
    t.chars.each do |char|
       return char if map[char] == 0
       map[char] -= 1
    end
end
```

### best solution
```
def find_the_difference(s, t)
    (t.sum - s.sum).chr
end
```

### 10.Sum of Two Integers (371)
[Bit Manipulation]()

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example:
Given a = 1 and b = 2, return 3.

#### working solution

```
# 32 bits integer max
MAX = 0x7FFFFFFF
# 32 bits interger min
MIN = 0x80000000

# @param {Integer} a
# @param {Integer} b
# @return {Integer}
def get_sum(a, b)
  # mask to get last 32 bits
  mask = 0xFFFFFFFF

  while b != 0
      # ^ get different bits and & gets double 1s, << moves carry
      a, b = (a ^ b) & mask, ((a & b) << 1) & mask
  end
  # if a is negative, get a's 32 bits complement positive first
  # then get 32-bit positive's Python complement negative
  a <= MAX ? a : ~(a ^ mask)
end
```
