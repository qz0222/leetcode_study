### 1. Intersection of Two Arrays (349)
[Binary Search](),
[Hash Table](),
[Two Pointers](),
[Sort]()

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example:
```
Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2].
```

Note:
1. Each element in the result must be unique.
2. The result can be in any order.

##### working solution:

```
def intersection(nums1, nums2)
    nums1.sort!
    nums2.sort!
    result = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length
        if nums1[i] == nums2[j]
            result << nums1[i]
            while nums1[i] == nums2[j]
                i += 1
            end
        end
        break if i == nums1.length
        while i < nums1.length && nums1[i] < nums2[j]
            i += 1
        end
        break if i == nums1.length
        while j < nums2.length && nums2[j] < nums1[i]
            j += 1
        end
    end
    result
end
```




### 2. Ransom Note (383)
[String]()

Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.
```
canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true
```

#### working solution

```
def can_construct(ransom_note, magazine)
    while ransom_note.length > 0
        new_ransom = ransom_note.gsub(ransom_note[0],"")
        new_mag = magazine.gsub(ransom_note[0],"")
        return false if ransom_note.length-new_ransom.length > magazine.length - new_mag.length
        ransom_note = new_ransom
        magazine = new_mag
    end
    true
end
```

#### better solution
```
def can_construct(ransom_note, magazine)
    unique = ransom_note.split('').uniq
    unique.each do |letter|
        return false if ransom_note.count(letter) > magazine.count(letter)
    end

    true
end
```



### 3. Sum of Left Leaves (404)
[Tree]()

Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

Example:
```
   3
  / \
 9  20
   /  \
  15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.
```


#### working solution

```
def sum_of_left_leaves(root)
    return 0 if root.nil?
    return root.left.val + sum_of_left_leaves(root.right) if root.left && root.left.left.nil? && root.left.right.nil?
    return sum_of_left_leaves(root.left) + sum_of_left_leaves(root.right)
end
```



### 4. First Unique Character in a String (387)

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:
```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

Example:
```
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1].
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
```

Note:
1. The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
2. The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

#### working solution(100%)

```
def first_uniq_char(s)
    i = 0
    dup = s
    while dup.length > 0
        current = dup[0]
        dup_deleted = dup.delete(current)
        return s.index(current) if dup.length == dup_deleted.length + 1
        dup = s2
    end
    return -1
end
```


### 5. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II  (122)
[Array](),
[Greedy]()

Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.

The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

Example :
```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
```

Note:

1. The sum of node values in any subtree won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.
2. All the tilt values won't exceed the range of 32-bit integer.

#### working solution
```
def max_profit(prices)
    return 0 if prices.nil?
    result = 0
    i = 1
    while i < prices.length
        if prices[i] > prices[i-1]
            result += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        end
        i += 1
    end
    result

end
```


### 6. Excel Sheet Column Number (171)
[Tree]()

Given a column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

For example:
```
A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28
```

#### working solution

```
def title_to_number(s)
    index = Hash[('A'..'Z').to_a.map.with_index{|el,idx|[el,idx+1]}]
    # p index
    i = 0
    result = 0
    while i < s.length
        result += 26 ** (s.length - i - 1) * index[s[i]]

        i += 1
    end
    result
end
```

#### better solution
```
def title_to_number(s)
    l = s.length
    col = s.slice!(-1).ord - 64
    s.each_char do |c|
        col += (26**l-=1) * (c.ord - 64)
    end if !s.empty?
    col
end
```



### 7. Delete Node in a Linked List (237)
[Linked List]()

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.


#### working solution

```
def delete_node(node)

    node.val = node.next.val
    node.next = node.next.next

end
```


### 8. Same Tree (100)
[Tree](),
[Depth-first Search]()

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.

Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

#### working solution
```
def is_same_tree(p, q)
    return true if p.nil? && q.nil?
    return false if p.nil? || q.nil?
    return false if p.val != q.val
    return is_same_tree(p.left,q.left) && is_same_tree(p.right,q.right)
end
```


### 9.Majority Element (169)
[Array](),
[Divide and Conquer](),
[Bit Manipulation]()

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

#### working solution

```
def majority_element(nums)
    remember_num = nums[0]
    remember_time = 1
    i = 1
    while i < nums.length
        if nums[i] == remember_num
            remember_time += 1
        elsif remember_time == 0
            remember_time = 1
            remember_num = nums[i]
        else
            remember_time -= 1
        end
        i += 1
    end
    remember_num
end
```

### 10. Valid Anagram (242)
[Hash Table](),
[Sort]()

Given two strings s and t, write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

For example,
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram", return true.
s = "rat", t = "car", return false.

Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

#### working solution

```
def is_anagram(s, t)
    s.chars.sort == t.chars.sort
end
```

#### better solution
.count() function 的速度非常快
```
def is_anagram(s, t)
	('a'..'z').each do |c|
		return false if s.count(c) != t.count(c)
	end
	return true
end
```
